## Chapter Overview

This chapter covers:

1. **Introduction to Kubernetes**: The origin, purpose, and evolution of Kubernetes
2. **What Kubernetes Is and Isn't**: Defining the boundaries and capabilities of Kubernetes
3. **Container Orchestration Fundamentals**: Understanding the need for orchestration
4. **Core Kubernetes Concepts**: Pods, services, deployments, and more
5. **Kubernetes Architecture in Depth**: Control plane, node components, and their interactions
6. **Kubernetes Container Runtimes**: CRI, containerd, CRI-O, and other runtime options

## Getting Started

If you're new to Kubernetes, we recommend starting with the following sequence:

1. Read the [summary.md](./summary.md) file to get an overview of the chapter
2. Explore the architecture diagrams in the [images/](./images/) directory
3. Follow the exercises in the [exercises/](./exercises/) directory in order
4. Use the [implementation_guide.md](./implementation_guide.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions
5. Reference the [code_examples/](./code_examples/) directory for practical implementations

## Prerequisites

To complete the exercises in this chapter, you'll need:

- A working Kubernetes cluster (minikube, kind, or cloud-based)
- kubectl CLI installed and configured
- Basic understanding of containers and Docker
- Familiarity with YAML and command line operations

## Key Concepts

- **Control Plane Components**: API Server, etcd, Controller Manager, Scheduler
- **Node Components**: Kubelet, Kube-proxy, Container Runtime
- **Workload Resources**: Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets
- **Service Resources**: Services, Ingress, Endpoints
- **Configuration Resources**: ConfigMaps, Secrets
- **Storage Resources**: Volumes, PersistentVolumes, PersistentVolumeClaims
- **Design Patterns**: Sidecar, Ambassador, Adapter patterns
- **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**: Standardized interface for container runtimes
