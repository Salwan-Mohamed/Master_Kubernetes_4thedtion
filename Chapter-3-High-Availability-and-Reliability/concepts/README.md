# High Availability Concepts

## Overview

Building reliable and highly available systems from unreliable components is one of the fundamental challenges in distributed systems. This section explores the core concepts that enable fault-tolerant Kubernetes deployments.

## Core Principle

> "Components will fail; you can take that to the bank. Hardware will fail, networks will fail, configuration will be wrong, software will have bugs, and people will make mistakes."

Accepting this reality, we must design systems that remain reliable and highly available even when components fail. The strategy involves:

1. **Start with redundancy**
2. **Detect component failure**
3. **Replace bad components quickly**

## Key Concepts

### 1. Redundancy

**Foundation of reliable systems at hardware and software levels**

- **Critical Component Rule**: If a component fails and you want the system to keep running, you must have another identical component ready
- **Kubernetes Implementation**: 
  - Replication controllers and replica sets handle stateless pods
  - etcd and API server require redundancy (typically 3+ nodes)
  - Stateful components need redundant persistent storage

**Example Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Redundancy for application layer
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web
        image: nginx:1.20
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 128Mi
```

### 2. Hot Swapping

**Replacing failed components without system downtime**

**Key Characteristics**:
- Minimal (ideally zero) interruption for users
- Easy for stateless components
- Complex for stateful components

**Two Main Approaches**:

#### Option 1: Give up in-flight transactions
- **Pros**: Much simpler implementation
- **Cons**: Clients must retry failed requests
- **Use Case**: Most resilient systems can handle occasional failures

#### Option 2: Keep hot replica in sync (active-active)
- **Pros**: No transaction loss
- **Cons**: Complex, fragile, performance overhead
- **Use Case**: Critical system components only

### 3. Leader Election

**Common pattern for coordinating distributed systems**

**How It Works**:
- Multiple identical components collaborate
- One component elected as leader
- Certain operations serialized through leader
- New leader elected when current leader fails

**Kubernetes Implementation**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kube-scheduler
spec:
  containers:
  - name: kube-scheduler
    image: k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler:v1.20.0
    command:
    - kube-scheduler
    - --leader-elect=true
    - --leader-elect-lease-duration=15s
    - --leader-elect-renew-deadline=10s
    - --leader-elect-retry-period=2s
```

### 4. Smart Load Balancing

**Distributing workload across multiple replicas**

**Benefits**:
- Scale up/down under varying load
- Automatic failure detection
- Traffic redirection from failed components
- Capacity restoration through new replicas

**Kubernetes Features**:
- Services and endpoints
- Replica sets
- Labels and selectors
- Ingress controllers

**Service Configuration Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: web-app
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: web-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: web-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

### 5. Idempotency

**System maintains consistent state even with repeated operations**

**The Challenge**:
- Many failures are temporary (networking, timeouts)
- Components may be marked as failed but still working
- Same work may be performed multiple times

**Solution Approaches**:
- **Exactly-once semantics**: Expensive in overhead and complexity
- **At-least-once semantics**: Accept duplicate work, maintain data integrity

**Design Principles**:
```bash
# Idempotent operations - safe to repeat
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml  # Can run multiple times safely
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml

# Non-idempotent operations - avoid repetition
kubectl create -f deployment.yaml  # Fails if resource exists
```

### 6. Self-Healing

**Automated detection and resolution of problems**

**Components**:
1. **Automated Detection**: Health checks, monitoring, alerting
2. **Automated Resolution**: Restart failed components, scale resources
3. **Checks and Balances**: Quotas and limits prevent runaway automation
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback paths and cached content

**Kubernetes Self-Healing Examples**:

#### Liveness Probes
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: self-healing-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myapp:1.0
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /healthz
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 30
      periodSeconds: 10
      failureThreshold: 3
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /ready
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
```

#### Resource Quotas
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: compute-quota
  namespace: production
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "4"
    requests.memory: 8Gi
    limits.cpu: "8"
    limits.memory: 16Gi
    pods: "10"
```

#### Pod Disruption Budget
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: web-app-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Redundancy
1. Deploy multiple replicas of critical components
2. Configure health checks and readiness probes
3. Set up basic monitoring and alerting

### Phase 2: Advanced Resilience
1. Implement leader election where needed
2. Configure pod disruption budgets
3. Set up automated scaling policies

### Phase 3: Self-Healing Systems
1. Deploy comprehensive monitoring stack
2. Implement automated remediation
3. Configure circuit breaker patterns
4. Set up chaos engineering practices

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Design for Failure**: Assume components will fail
2. **Embrace Redundancy**: Multiple instances of critical components
3. **Monitor Everything**: Comprehensive observability
4. **Automate Recovery**: Self-healing where possible
5. **Test Failure Scenarios**: Regular chaos engineering
6. **Plan for Degradation**: Graceful fallback mechanisms

## Common Anti-Patterns

❌ **Single Points of Failure**: No redundancy for critical components
❌ **Tight Coupling**: Components that can't function independently
❌ **No Health Checks**: Can't detect failed components
❌ **Manual Recovery**: Relying on human intervention
❌ **Untested Failure Modes**: Assuming backup systems work
